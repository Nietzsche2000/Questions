Rules:
1. Method of nonstatic and static with identical signatures are not allowed in the inheritance chain.
2. JVM does not allow static and non-static variables of the same name.
3. When casting ONLY think about the dynamic type and then confirm that you are casting to the same level as the dynamic or lower (means same class or subclass)
