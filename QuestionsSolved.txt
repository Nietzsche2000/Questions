3. Intellij no Directories: How to create a directory and not a package? --> Not possible. Problems in Intellij
4. Intellij running just one particular file rather than the entire folder. --> Comment out. 
5. Questions on array and their class. Are they primitive, reference? Are they objects?--> Something inbetween.
6. Are all reference types objects? Is null a primitive type or a reference type?--> treat it as a Primitive type.
7. Overriding and Overloading method and non-static lookup with multiple extended classes and casting.  
8. Is void a primitive type? Explore void? is it a class? --> Class.getPrimitive("void").
10. Is it possible to test console output using JUnit? --> System.out.print(). --> return String then print in the end. System.setOut(); Write another method that returns the string that would be used to print in the particular function.
11. Is super the reference to the super instance that gets created when the instance is constructed? --> No idea. 
12. In static method lookup, during runtime, the method will be run that was selected in static lookup during compile time? --> Look at static type, find the method, go up and find better method with better parameter if not present in the called static class.
14. Covariant question: how to instantiate line 32? --> Array.newInstance(QuestionArray.test.class, size)
15. How to add data from one branch to another on git?  --> checkout branch.
