7. Overriding and Overloading method and non-static lookup with multiple extended classes and casting.  
8. Is void a primitive type? Explore void? is it a class?
9. Inner class definitions, static inner classes, non-static classes instantiation. 
10. Is it possible to test console output using JUnit? --> System.out.print().
11. Is super the reference to the super instance that gets created when the instance is constructed?
12. In static method lookup, during runtime, the method will be run that was selected in static lookup during compile time?
13. Overriding instance classes.
14. Covariant question: how to instantiate line 32?
15. How do generics broken program when I do not specify the type of the of the object inside the class. --> look at file weirdgenerics.java

17. When there is a default method in an interface how does it look up if you call a method from it. Like in project 1? How does this work?
